# tornettools

![](https://github.com/shadow/tornettools/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

tornettools is a utility to guide you through the Tor network
experimentation process using Shadow, by assisting with the
following experimentation steps:

  - **stage**:     Process Tor metrics data for staging network generation
  - **generate**:  Generate TorNet network configurations
  - **simulate**:  Run a TorNet simulation in Shadow
  - **parse**:     Parse useful data from simulation log files
  - **plot**:      Plot previously parsed data to visualize results
  - **archive**:   Cleanup and compress Shadow simulation data

The configuration files that are generated can be run in the
[Shadow network simulator](https://github.com/shadow/shadow);
[NetMirage](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/netmirage)
and
[Chutney](https://gitweb.torproject.org/chutney.git)
may eventually support the files generated with this tool.

The generated networks include the use of
[TGen](https://github.com/shadow/tgen)
for the generation of realistic background traffic, and
[OnionTrace](https://github.com/shadow/oniontrace)
for the collection of information from Tor throughout an experiment.

This tool was initially created as part of the following research publication. Please cite this paper if you use this tool in your work:

### Note about versioning

Development of tornettools is slow and typically focuses on changes that keep the tool in
sync with changes being made in Shadow. Thus, you should generally just ignore the tornettools
version numbers and use the latest version. Sometimes you might want to pin to a specific
version that is known to be compatible with your version of Shadow, e.g., when building
container images, and in this case we recommend pinning to a specific commit hash.

We do use version numbers, but they have historically been based on vibes rather than semver
and we don't want to introduce the overhead of following a more strict policy than that.

### setup is easy with virtualenv and pip

    python3 -m venv toolsenv
    source toolsenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # if you plan to make changes to tornettools, you can add the '--editable' pip install flag
    # to avoid the need to re-run 'pip install' after every modification:
    # https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs
    pip install --ignore-installed .

### read the help menus

    tornettools -h
    tornettools stage -h
    tornettools generate -h
    tornettools simulate -h
    tornettools parse -h
    tornettools plot -h
    tornettools archive -h

### grab the data we need

    wget https://collector.torproject.org/archive/relay-descriptors/consensuses/consensuses-2020-11.tar.xz
    wget https://collector.torproject.org/archive/relay-descriptors/server-descriptors/server-descriptors-2020-11.tar.xz
    wget https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.csv
    wget https://collector.torproject.org/archive/onionperf/onionperf-2020-11.tar.xz
    wget -O bandwidth-2020-11.csv "https://metrics.torproject.org/bandwidth.csv?start=2020-11-01&end=2020-11-30"

### extract

    tar xaf consensuses-2020-11.tar.xz
    tar xaf server-descriptors-2020-11.tar.xz
    tar xaf onionperf-2020-11.tar.xz

### we also utilize privcount Tor traffic model measurements

    git clone https://github.com/tmodel-ccs2018/tmodel-ccs2018.github.io.git

### we also need tor

    sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev libevent-dev build-essential automake zlib1g zlib1g-dev
    git clone https://git.torproject.org/tor.git
    cd tor
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --disable-asciidoc --disable-unittests --disable-manpage --disable-html-manual
    make -j$(nproc)
    cd ..

### install additional executables used by tornettools

`tornettools` also uses the `faketime`, `dstat`, `free`, and `xz` command-line
tools. On Ubuntu these can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install faketime dstat procps xz-utils

### in order to generate, we need a tor and tor-gencert binaries (to generate relay keys)

    export PATH=${PATH}:`pwd`/tor/src/core/or:`pwd`/tor/src/app:`pwd`/tor/src/tools

### stage first, process relay and user info

    tornettools stage \
        consensuses-2020-11 \
        server-descriptors-2020-11 \
        userstats-relay-country.csv \
        tmodel-ccs2018.github.io \
        --onionperf_data_path onionperf-2020-11 \
        --bandwidth_data_path bandwidth-2020-11.csv \
        --geoip_path tor/src/config/geoip

### now we can used the staged files to generate many times

For example, use `--network_scale 0.01` to generate a private Tor network at '1%' the scale of public Tor:

    tornettools generate \
        relayinfo_staging_2020-11-01--2020-11-30.json \
        userinfo_staging_2020-11-01--2020-11-30.json \
        networkinfo_staging.gml \
        tmodel-ccs2018.github.io \
        --network_scale 0.01 \
        --prefix tornet-0.01

### now you can run a simulation and process the results

Make sure you have already installed [shadow](https://github.com/shadow/shadow), [tgen](https://github.com/shadow/tgen), and [oniontrace](https://github.com/shadow/oniontrace).

Note that simulating a '1%' Tor network for 60 simulation minutes can take as much as 30GiB of RAM.

    tornettools simulate tornet-0.01
    tornettools parse tornet-0.01
    tornettools plot \
        tornet-0.01 \
        --tor_metrics_path tor_metrics_2020-11-01--2020-11-30.json \
        --prefix pdfs
    tornettools archive tornet-0.01

Performance metrics are plotted in the graph files in the pdfs directory.
